Inspired on [Haversine's game](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiHQN1q8ln4) and [Undertow game](http://www.scpcbgame.com/scp-087-b.html) of SCP-087, also in the Minecraft cubic and pixeled style.

> This version is a **completely remake** of my old game with the same name, adding procedural generation for the floors and random events.
