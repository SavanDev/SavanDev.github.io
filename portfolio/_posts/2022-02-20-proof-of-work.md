**Congratulations, you have a new job!**

You got a job in a well-known factory in your city and today is the day you are tested to see if you are suitable for the position.

Your objective is, together with another colleague, to control the load of the factory's generators and prevent them from overloading.

You wouldn't want the place to blow up on your first day, would you?
