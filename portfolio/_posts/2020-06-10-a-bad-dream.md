Inspired in [Imscared](https://gamejolt.com/games/imscared/146901).

A short game where your objective is escape from an unknown place and return to your home safely. You will cross with old friends and a new partner who will help you along the way.

And maybe... someone that need your help.

The game can try to interact with you outside of it, so check the desktop if something strange happens.
